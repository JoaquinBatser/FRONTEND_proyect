                        <h2>PURGATORIO</h2>
                         <p>Purgatorio is a poetic masterpiece that continues the narrative of the Divine Comedy, which began in Inferno, the first
                        part of the trilogy. The poem follows Dante's journey through the realm of Purgatory, where souls are purged of their
                        sins before they can enter Heaven. The poem is divided into 33 cantos, with an additional introductory canto, and is
                        written in the same terza rima verse form as Inferno.
                        
                        In Purgatorio, Dante is guided by the Roman poet Virgil, who represents human reason. Together, they climb the mountain
                        of Purgatory, which is divided into seven terraces, each representing a different sin. The terraces are organized in a
                        manner that reflects the hierarchy of sins, with the most severe sins being punished on the lower levels of the
                        mountain.
                        
                        The punishments in Purgatory are designed to purge the souls of their sins, rather than to inflict eternal suffering
                        like in Inferno. The punishments are physical and symbolic, and the souls on each terrace are hopeful of eventually
                        being saved. One of the key themes of Purgatorio is the concept of contrapasso, which is the punishment that fits the
                        sin. Dante presents a vivid and intricate system of contrapasso, where the punishment for a sin is closely related to
                        the nature of the sin itself. For example, souls who were envious in life have their eyes sewn shut, while those who
                        were prideful must carry heavy stones on their backs to symbolize the burden of their own arrogance.</p>

                        <h2>PARADISO</h2>
                         <p>Paradiso, the final part of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The poem follows Dante's journey through the nine spheres of Heaven, where he is guided by his
                        beloved Beatrice, who represents divine revelation. As Dante ascends through each sphere, he encounters angels, saints,
                        and other holy figures, who reveal the mysteries of God and the nature of divine love, wisdom, and beauty.
                        
                        Paradiso is a work of profound spirituality, theology, and philosophy. Dante's journey through Heaven is a metaphor for
                        the soul's journey towards God, and the poem is filled with complex symbolism and allegory that requires careful
                        interpretation. Each sphere of Heaven represents a different aspect of God's creation and contains souls who have
                        attained a certain level of spiritual enlightenment. The souls in each sphere are united in their devotion to God and
                        their desire to share in the divine love and glory.
                        
                        One of the key themes of Paradiso is the idea of divine love, which is presented as the highest and most noble form of
                        love. Dante portrays God as the ultimate source of love and celebrates the beauty and power of divine love through his
                        descriptions of the souls in Heaven. Dante's love for Beatrice is also an important theme of the poem, and his journey
                        through Heaven is in part a journey towards a deeper understanding of the nature of love.</p>
