            <div class="row inferno-2-text">
                <p>The Inferno, the first part of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, is a masterpiece of world literature that has captivated
                readers for centuries. The poem portrays the poet's descent into the depths of Hell, where he encounters a diverse cast
                of sinners and witnesses the punishments they suffer for their transgressions.
                
                The journey through Hell is divided into nine circles, each representing a different category of sin and corresponding
                punishment. The first circle is reserved for those who died before being baptized, while the second is for those who
                succumbed to their carnal desires. The third circle is for the gluttonous, while the fourth is for the hoarders and the
                spendthrifts. The fifth circle is for the wrathful and the sullen, while the sixth is for the heretics. The seventh
                circle is divided into three sub-circles, with each reserved for a different type of violent offender. The eighth circle
                is for the fraudsters, and the ninth and final circle is for the betrayers, with Satan himself at the very bottom.
                
                As Dante descends through the circles of Hell, he encounters a vast array of sinners, ranging from historical and
                mythological figures to contemporary individuals from his own time. The punishments inflicted upon them are both
                grotesque and inventive, reflecting Dante's moral and theological views. The poem explores themes such as justice, sin,
                redemption, and divine retribution, and presents a vivid and often harrowing vision of the consequences of immoral
                behavior.
                
                The Inferno is a work of profound literary and historical significance, and it has had a lasting impact on Western
                literature and culture. It is also a powerful and evocative portrayal of human suffering and the consequences of sin,
                and it offers a stark warning about the dangers of temptation and the importance of moral and ethical behavior. Through
                his descriptions of the punishments in Hell, Dante offers a compelling commentary on the nature of sin and the human
                condition. Despite its dark subject matter, the poem is also a work of great beauty and artistry, and it showcases
                Dante's skill as a poet and his deep understanding of human nature.</p>
